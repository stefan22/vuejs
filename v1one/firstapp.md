#### vue is:
- fast (virtual DOM manages efficient updates)
- unobtrusive (plays nicely with other libraries and exisiting js)
- easy to adapt when you need to add just a few features to a website
- no need to setup a tool chain of assets or transpile modern versions of js
- it has support for things like single file components, plugins for routing, state
  management, and command-line tools to work with module bundlers like webpack
